##### Preparation:

Put kidney beans in a saucepan and cover them with the water.  Soak 3 to 4 hours. Add extra water
and salt.  Cook until tender, about 1 hour.  Watch the water level and add more if necessary.

Heat tomato juice to a boil.  Pour over raw bulgar.  Cover and let stand at least 15 min. It will
be crunchy, so it can absorb more later.

Saute onions and garlic in olive oil . Add carrots, celery and spices.  When vegetables are almost done,
add peppers.  Cook until tender.

Combine beans, bulgar, sauted vegetables, tomatoes, lemon juice, tomato paste, black beans, corn 
and beer or wine.  Heat together gently in a kettle over a double boiler, or covered in a 
moderate oven.

Serve topped with cheese and parsley.
