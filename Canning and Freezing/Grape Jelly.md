## Grape Jelly

##### Ingredients:
Quantity        |    Ingredient
--------------- | -------------------------------------
4 cups          | grape juice
3 tbsp. (1 pkt.)| low sugar pectin 
1/4 cup         | lemon or lime juice
1-1/4 cup       | granulated sugar

##### Preparation:
Stir grape juice together with sugar, pectin, and citrus juice and bring to a boil over high heat. Cook until the 
mixture registers 220Â°F on a candy or instant read thermometer. 

Turn off heat and skim any foam with a spoon. Ladle jam into prepared jars, leaving a quarter inch of head space. 
Wipe the rims of the jar lids with a clean kitchen or paper towel and seal.

Place the sealed jars back into the canning kettle. When all jars are added, make sure that the water level 
clears the jar lids by at least one inch. Add more water if necessary, and, over high heat, bring the water back 
up to a boil. Once the water boils, set a timer for ten minutes.
