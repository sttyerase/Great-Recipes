------------------- | -------------------------------------
Crust:              | 
1 pkg.              | Pillsbury or similar pre-make pie crust. (Two crusts per package)
Filling:            |
5 - 6 cups          | Jonathan apples peeled and cut into chunks
3 tblspn.           | lemon juice
3/4 cup             | brown sugar
3/4 cup             | white sugar
4 tblspn.           | all-purpose flour
1 tblspn.           | corn starch
1/2 tsp.            | ground cinnamon
1/4 tsp.            | ground cloves


##### Preparation:

Preheat oven to 425°.

Peel and core the apples and cut into chunks.  Add the lemon juice to the apples.   In a small bowl combine dry 
ingredients and mix well to eliminate lumps from the brown sugar. Pour apples into prepared pie shell and cover
with the dry ingredients.  Cover with the top crust and seal.  Be sure to create vent holes with a fork to
allow steam to escape.  Cover crust edge with foil or other baking shield to prevent burning.

Bake at 425° for 12 min.  Reduce heat to 350° and continue to bake for 50 - 55 min, until crust is golden on top
and filling is cooked through.
