##### Preparation:

In medium bowl, mix flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cut in shortening, using pastry blender (or pulling 2 table knives 
through ingredients in opposite directions), until particles are size of small peas. Sprinkle with cold 
water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with fork until all flour is moistened and pastry almost cleans 
side of bowl (1 to 2 teaspoons more water can be added if necessary).

Heat oven to 375Â°F. With floured rolling pin, roll pastry into round 2 inches larger than upside-down 9-inch 
glass pie plate. Fold pastry into fourths; place in pie plate. Unfold and ease into plate, pressing firmly 
against bottom and side. Trim overhanging edge of pastry 1 inch from rim of pie plate. Fold and roll pastry 
under, even with plate; flute as desired.

In large bowl, beat sugar, butter, corn syrup, bourbon, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the eggs with wire whisk or hand 
beater. Stir in pecans and chocolate chips. Pour into pastry-lined pie plate. Cover edge of pastry with 2- to 3-inch 
strip of foil to prevent excessive browning.

Bake 40 to 50 minutes or until set, removing foil for last 15 minutes of baking. Cool 30 minutes. Refrigerate 
until chilled, about 2 hours.
