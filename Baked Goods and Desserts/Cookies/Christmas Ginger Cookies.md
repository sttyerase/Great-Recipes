------------------- | -------------------------------------
Dry Ingredients:    |
2-1/2 cups          | unbleached flour
2 tsp.              | baking soda
2 tsp.              | cinnamon
1/2 tsp.            | salt
1 tblsp. + 2 tsp.   | powdered ginger
Wet Ingredients:    |
3/4 cup             | butter
1 cup               | brown sugar
1/4 cup             | molasses
1                   | egg

##### Preparation:
In a medium bowl mix thoroughly all dry ingredients.  In a large bowl, cream together butter and sugar.
In a small bowl, whisk briskly molasses and egg.  Add molasses and egg mixture to sugar and butter
mixture and stir to combine.  Add dry ingredients to wet mixture, little at a time. The last few additions
may be easier to mix with clean hands.  Once thoroughly mixed, put the entire dough ball in the refrigerator
to chill.

Heat oven to 375&deg;.  Place the rack in the middle of the oven, not too close to the bottom. Cookies
tend to burn underneath.  Form into approx. 2" balls and roll in granulated sugar.  Bake 9 min. until
lots of cracks on top, but not completely spread out flat.  Keep dough chilled in refrigerator between batches.
