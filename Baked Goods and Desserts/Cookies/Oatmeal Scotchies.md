|------------|--------------------------|
| 1-1/2 cups | all-purpose flour        |
| 1/2 tsp.   | ground cinnamon          |
| 1 tsp.     | baking soda              |
| 3/4 tsp.   | salt                     |
| 1 cup      | unsalted butter softened |
| 1 cup      | packed dark brown sugar  |
| 1/2 cup    | granulated sugar         |
| 2          | large eggs               |
| 1 Tblsp.   | Grandma's dark molasses  |
| 2 tsp.     | pure vanilla extract     |
| 3 cups     | whole rolled oats        |
| 2 cups     | butterscotch morsels     |

##### Preparation:
Whisk flour, cinnamon, baking soda and salt together in a medium bowl.  Set aside

In a large bowl using a hand mixer or a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat
the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed, until
combined and creamy, about 2 minutes.  Add the eggs, molasses and vanilla and beat on high speed
until combined, about 1 minute.  Scrape down the sides and up the bowl and beat again as needed to combine.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until combined.  On low speed beat in the
oats and butterscotch morsels.  Dough will be thick and sticky.  Cover and chill the dough for at least
45 minutes. 

Preheat oven to 350&deg;F.  Press dough into 13" x 9" baking pan.  Bake for 13 to 14 minutes or until
lightly browned on the edges.  Once cooled, cut into squares.
