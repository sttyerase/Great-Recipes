## S'mores Crunch Wraps* (Modified)

##### Ingredients:

| Quantity  | Ingredient            |
|-----------|-----------------------|
| 6         | large flour tortillas |
| 1 cup     | graham cracker crumbs |
| 1/2 cup   | mini marshmallows     |
| 1 cup     | chocolate chips       |
| 2 tblspn. | melted butter         |
| 1 tblspn. | vegetable oil         |

##### Preparation:
Lay out the flour tortillas on a clean surface. Brush each tortilla with melted butter 
to help the graham cracker crumbs stick.

Sprinkle a generous amount of graham cracker crumbs over each buttered tortilla. Press 
the crumbs gently into the tortilla to ensure they adhere well.

In the center of each tortilla, place a handful of mini marshmallows and chocolate chips. 
Try to keep the filling in a compact mound to make wrapping easier.

Fold the edges of the tortilla up and over the filling, creating a wrap. Make sure the 
filling is securely enclosed within the tortilla.

Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the vegetable oil.  Spread evenly across the
pan.  Place the wrapped tortillas seam-side down in the skillet. Cook for 2-3 minutes 
on each side or until golden brown and crispy.

Remove the Sâ€™mores Crunchwraps from the skillet and let them cool slightly before serving.
