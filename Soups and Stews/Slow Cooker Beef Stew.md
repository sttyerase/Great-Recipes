1/2 tsp.        | fresh ground black pepper
2 lbs.          | stew beef, cubed (top round or flank steak)
2 Tblsp.        | olive oil
1-1/2 cups      | beef broth
1/2 cup         | red wine
1 Tblsp.        | Worchestershire sauce
3               | potatoes, diced
1               | onion, quartered
4               | carrots, sliced
1 stalk         | celery, chopped
2 tsp.          | minced garlic
1 tsp.          | rubbed sage
1 tsp.          | dried rosemary
1 tsp.          | paprika

##### Preparation:
Pour flour, garlic powder, and black pepper together into a large resealable plastic 
bag and shake to mix. Place stew beef in bag, seal the bag, and shake to coat beef 
to coat completely.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; saute coated beef 
until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Place the beef into the slow cooker.

Measure beef broth, red wine, and Worcestershire sauce together in a 2-cup measure. Pour 
broth mixture into the same skillet that browned the beef cubes. Add the remaining flour and
seasoning from the bag in which the beef was coated.  Bring to a boil, continually scraping 
the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the skillet. Transfer broth mixture to the 
slow cooker.

Mix potatoes, carrots, celery, garlic, and paprika into beef mixture.  Cook on High for 
1 hour. Reduce heat to Low and cook until meat is tender, 6 to 7 hours.
