##### Preparation:
Pat chicken and lamb dry with paper towels and season with salt and pepper. Heat oil in Dutch oven over 
medium-high heat until just smoking. Brown chicken, about 5 minutes per side; transfer to plate. Pour 
off fat from pan and reserve. (You should have about 3 tablespoons fat; if you have less, supplement with 
vegetable oil.) Add 1 tablespoon reserved fat to Dutch oven and heat until just smoking. Brown half of chops, 
about 5 minutes per side; transfer to plate. Repeat with additional 1 tablespoon fat and remaining chops.

Add remaining fat and onions to now-empty pot and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and 
flour and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in broth, tomatoes, and Worcestershire, scraping up any 
browned bits with wooden spoon. Return chicken and lamb to pot and bring to boil.

Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, covered, until chicken is tender, about 30 minutes. Transfer chicken 
to plate. When cool enough to handle, pull chicken into bite-sized pieces and reserve in refrigerator; 
discard bones and skin. Continue to simmer stew until lamb is tender, about 40 minutes longer. Transfer 
lamb to plate. When cool enough to handle, pull lamb into bite-sized pieces and reserve in 
refrigerator; discard bones.

Add potatoes to pot and simmer until tender, about 15 minutes. Add corn, lima beans, reserved chicken, and 
reserved lamb and simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice and 3/4 teaspoon pepper. 
Season with salt. Skim fat, if necessary. Serve.
