--------------- | -------------------------------------
1 lb.           | Italian sausage
1 medium        | onion finely chopped
3 cloves        | garlic, minced
1 tsp.          | dried basil
1 tsp.          | dried oregano
1 tsp.          | dried parsley
1/2 tsp.        | dried thyme
2 pinches       | crushed red pepper
2 cups          | beef broth
1-1/2 tblspn.   | tomato paste
1 14 oz. can    | fire roasted tomatoes
4 cups          | vegetable broth
10 oz.          | refrigerated tortellini
3 cups          | arugala or spinach
4 oz.           | grated parmesan cheese

##### Preparation:
Brown the Italian Sausage in a Dutch Oven or stockpot over medium heat.  When it is 
almost fully browned add the onion and cook until the sausage is done browning and 
the onion has softened.  Turn the heat to low and add the garlic, basil, oregano, 
parsley, thyme and crushed red pepper; cook for 1 minute stirring constantly.

In a small bowl whisk the tomato paste with about 1/2 cup beef broth. Add the vegetable 
broth, remaining beef broth, fire roasted tomatoes and thinned out tomato paste.  Increase 
the heat to medium low and simmer for 3-4 minutes.

Add the cheese tortellini and simmer for 10-15 minutes or until the tortellinis are cooked 
to your desired tenderness.  Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the arugula.  Add 
salt and pepper to taste.  Sprinkle each bowl with 1-2 tablespoon freshly grated Parmesan cheese.

##### Notes:
* You can substitute spinach for arugula without any changes to the recipe.
* Most grocery stores carry refrigerated pasta although you may have to ask where it is 
in the store.  You can always substitute frozen cheese tortellini.
* This soup is really so quick and easy that is doable on a weeknight.
* Dried herbs work best in soup where their flavors have time to permeate the whole pot.  
Best to add them right before the liquids and stir for about 1 minute.
* Buy the freshest dried herbs you can get.  If they donâ€™t have much smell to them anymore 
then they have lost their potency and they will not lend much to the recipe.  It is time to replace them.
* The crushed red pepper adds a very minuscule amount of heat but if the idea of adding it leaves you 
apprehensive then omit it.
