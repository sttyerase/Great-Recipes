##### Preparation:
In a large heavy-bottomed saucepan over medium heat, warm the olive oil.  Add onion and cook until
soft, 6 minutes.  Add paprika and cumin and cook for another minute.

Add chicken stock, clam juice, potatoes and 1/2 of tomatoes.  Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer.
Cover and cook until potatoes are softened, but not quite done about 10 minutes.

Add fish, corn and remaining tomatoes.  Return to a gentle simmer and cook until corn is hot and fish
is opaque (safe internal temp. 145&deg;F), about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

Serve garnished with cilantro and lime wedges.
