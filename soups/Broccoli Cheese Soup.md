Quantity        |    Ingredient
--------------- | -------------------------------------
3/4 cup         | butter
3/4 cup         | all-purpose flour
9 cups          | chicken stock
9 cups          | milk
1 tsp.          | salt
1-1/2 tsp.      | white pepper
5 cups          | fresh broccoli florets
1-1/2 lbs.      | processed cheese, shredded
3 cups          | cheddar cheese, shredded

##### Preparation:
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat, and mix in the flour.  Reduce
heat to low and cook, stirring constantly, about 2 min.  Mix in the chicken stock
and milk, and season with salt and white pepper.  Bring to a boil, reduce heat
to low, and simmer about 10 minutes.

Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil.  Place the broccoli in the
boiling water, and cook 2 minutes, or until just tender. Remove from heat, drain
and set aside.

Gradually mix the processed cheese and cheddar cheese into the large pot until
melted.  Mix in the broccoli.  Continue cooking about 5 minutes.
