| 1 lb.    | large scallops patted dry |
| 4 tbsp.  | butter, melted            |

##### Preparation:
Preheat the oven to 400&deg;F.

In a small bowl, mix the melted butter, minced garlic, lemon juice, salt and pepper.

Place the scallops in a single layer in a baking dish.  Pour the garlic butter mixture over
the scallops, ensuring they are well coated.  In another bowl, mix the breadcrumbs, Parmesan
cheese and parsley.  Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the scallops.

Bake the scallops for 10 - 12 minutes, or until the scallops are opaque and the breadcrumb
topping is golden brown.  Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side.
