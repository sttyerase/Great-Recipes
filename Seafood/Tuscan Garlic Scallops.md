##### Ingredients:
| Quantity  | Ingredient             |
|-----------|------------------------|
| 1 tblspn. | olive oil              |
| 1 pound   | scallops               |
| 3         | garlic cloves          |
| 2 tblspn. | olive oil              |
| 1 cup     | heavy cream            |
| 1/2 cup   | chicken broth          |
| 1 tsp.    | garlic powder          |
| 1 tsp.    | Italian seasoning      |
| 1/2 cup   | grated Parmesan cheese |
| 1 cup     | chopped spinach        |
| 1/2 cup   | sun-dried tomatoes     |

##### Preparation:
Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat until it's hot and sizzling.
Pat the scallops dry with a paper towel to ensure they get a nice golden crust when seared.  Add the scallops
in a single layer, working in batches if needed.  Sear them until they are golden on one side 
and then flip and sear on the other side.  Transfer the seared scallops to a plate.

In the same skillet add remaining olive oil and saute minced garlic until it becomes fragrant, usually
about 30 seconds.  Pour in chicken broth, heavy cream, garlic powder, Italian seasoning and Parmesan
cheese.  Whisk everything together until the sauce starts to thicken.  Add the sun-dried tomatoes and
spinach to the sauce, allowing the spinach to gently wilt as the sauce simmers.  Carefully add the seared 
scallops back to the sauce and toss gently to coat evenly.

Serve the scallops over pasta or with other favorite side dish.  Garnish with fresh herbs or additional Parmesan cheese,
if desired.
