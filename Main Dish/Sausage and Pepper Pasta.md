##### Preparation:
Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot and cook over medium 
heat until the sausage is browned and firm enough to slice. It doesn't have to be cooked
through at this point.

While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.
Once the sausage is browned, remove it from the pot and add the peppers, onions, and garlic.  Let
them cook while you slice the sausage into thin medallions.

After the peppers and onions have softened, return the sliced sausage to the pot along with the
diced tomatoes, basil, oregano and the crushed red pepper.  Stir to combine and continue to cook
over medium heat.

Cook the pasta according to directions for about 7 min., until tender, but still firm, slightly
undercooked.  Drain it in a colander and add it to the pot with the pepper sauce for about 
5 more minutes, until it has absorbed most of the liquid in the pot.  Add spaghetti sauce and
salt to taste.
