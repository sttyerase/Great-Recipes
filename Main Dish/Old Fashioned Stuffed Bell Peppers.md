## Old Fashioned Stuffed Bell Peppers*

##### Ingredients:
| Quantity  | Ingredient      |
|-----------|-----------------|
| 3 medium  | bell peppers    |
| 1/2 pound | raw ground beef |
| 1/2 cup   | cooked rice     |
| 1 small   | onion, diced    |
| 1         | egg             |
| pinch     | salt and pepper |
| 8 oz.     | tomato sauce    |

##### Preparation:
Preheat oven to 350&deg;. Spray a baking dish, large enough to hold the peppers in an upright position, 
with non-stick cooking spray. 

Cut off the tops of the peppers, remove the seeds and wash and dry them.

Combine raw hamburger, cooked rice, diced onions, egg and a pinch of salt and pepper. Stuff the
peppers with the hamburger mixture, leaving room at the top for sauce. 

Place the peppers in the prepared dish.  Pour tomato sauce into the top of each pepper. Add
additional dried herbs to taste as desired.

Bake for 1 hour.

#### Notes:

Any color bell peppers will work.

No need to boil or blanche the peppers.

Use a baking dish that holds the peppers upright without a lot of extra room.
