##### Preparation:
In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter, sugar, eggs and vanilla.  Combine flour, salt and soda and 
add to creamed mixture alternately with milk, mixing well after each addition.

Split dough in half and place in second mixing bowl.  To first half of dough, add melted chocolate and walnuts.  Spread
this mixture in the bottom of a greased 13" x 9" x 2" baking pan.  Arrange graham crackers over the dough.  Add 
chocolate piecees to remaining dough.  Drop by tablespoon on top of graham crackers and spread evenly to cover. Bake
in 375&deg; oven 25 to 30 minutes.  Let cool and cut into bars. 

Note: Mom found the original recipe difficult to work with in a 13" x 9" pan, so she doubled the recipe. Also, she
ommitted the graham crackers to make a simple two-layer bar cookie.
