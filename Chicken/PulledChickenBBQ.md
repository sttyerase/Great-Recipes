## Crockpot BBQ Chicken

##### Ingredients:
| Quantity       |    Ingredient|
|----------------| -------------------------------------|
 | 3 lbs. (5-6)   | boneless,skinless chicken breasts, trimmed of fat|
 | 1-1/2 cups     | BBQ sauce (I use Montgomery Inn)|
 | 1/2 medium     | onion|
 | 1 Tblsp        | olive oil|
 | 1 Tblsp        | Worchestershire sauce|
 | 2 Tblsp        | brown sugar|


##### Preparation:

1. Stir together all sauce ingredients in a 5-6 qt. slow cooker.
2. Add chicken and turn to coat.  Cover and cook on high 3 to 4 hours or on low for 6 â€“ 7 hours. Chicken is
   done when cooked through and easy to shred.
3. Remove chicken to a cutting board and shred each breast using two forks. Place shredded chicken
   back in the crock pot and stir to coat with the yummy sauce.
